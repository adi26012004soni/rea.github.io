    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state in the western Himalayas, and most of it lies in the foothills of the
        Dhauladhar range. On its north is the state of Jammu & Kashmir, to its west is Punjab, Haryana lies towards the
        southwest and Uttarakhand to the northeast. It rubs international borders with Tibet on the east.
        Himachal Pradesh is a snow-laden land and it is spread across numerous valleys, with meandering rivers, deep
        valleys, and stunning vistas. The perennial rivers Chenab, Ravi, Beas, Sutlej and the Yamuna pass through the
        state, irrigating its fertile lands. Many adventure seekers are also drawn to Himachal for the numerous sports
        activities that they can indulge in.

    <h3 >When you should visit Himachal Pradesh</h3>
    <p  style="font-size: 1.25em;font-family: 'Lora', serif;">
Himachal Pradesh has tremendous variation in its elevation, and that affects the climatic conditions in the
state greatly. The southern parts experience hot and humid weather, and as you move up north and to east,
the weather gets steadily cold and glacial. Dharamsala receives heavy rainfall, while Spiti and Lahaul cold
and receive almost no rain.
Himachal Pradesh has three broad seasons – summer, winter and the monsoon.
Summer is from mid-April till end June, and this is when it can get very hot except high-altitude which
experience a mild summer. Late November until mid-March is the Himachal Pradesh winter and there snowfall in
the northern regions of the state.
The best time to visit when winter is waning, and summer is yet to hit with its full fury. The months from
February to end of April are considered to the best for travellers.

        <h3>How To Get To Himachal Pradesh</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.25em; font-family: 'Lora', serif;" ><strong>By flight:</strong> Himachal Pradesh is connected to Delhi and Chandigarh from its three domestic
                 airports in Kangra, Kullu and Shimla districts.
                 <br>
<strong>By rail:</strong>   Himachal is known for its quaint narrow-gauge railways – the Kalka-Shimla Railway and the  
                  Pathankot-Jogindernagar line, of which the former is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Riding on 
                 these lines gives you spectacular views of the surrounding landscape and is a treat
                 you don’t want to miss. 
                 A broad-gauge railway track connects Amb and Una to Delhi. <br>
<strong>By road:</strong>   Himachal Pradesh has an extensive road network that connects every part of the state to the rest
                 of the country. Many people opt to drive down from neighbouring states. Alternatively, there are several
                 private and state-owned buses running through and outside Himachal Pradesh.
